# r_qtl_maize_mapping
A repo with some genralized code for QTL mapping in maize using R/qtl

A link to a really nice book by Karl Broman and Saunak Sen on QTL mapping using R/qtl

The link to Karl Broman's website with some nice examples on QTL mapping (has examples of correct formatting of input data!)

This repo includes code that was originally used to map the Tcb1-s and Ga1-s loci in maize. It has been generalized for other mapping cases in maize.
